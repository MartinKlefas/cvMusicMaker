# Computer Vision Music Maker

This will be a project very similar to https://beatblocks.app/ wherein they use Lego to control a sound board and make music.

The aim of this project is to better understand:

 - Fast Object Recognition
 - Multi-object detection
 - Customisable speed control
 - UI and UX

At present there is no working code, and a UML design is in progress.
