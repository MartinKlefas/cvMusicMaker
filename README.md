# Computer Vision Music Maker

This project will be similar to [BeatBlocks](https://beatblocks.app/), where Lego blocks are used to control a soundboard and create music.

The aim of this project is to gain a better understanding of:

-   Fast Object Recognition
-   Multi-object detection
-   Customizable speed control
-   UI and UX

Currently, there is no working code, and a UML design is in progress.
